## Hosted Link: https://goofy-thompson-2f6b20.netlify.app/

## Task:

Create a tool for teachers to author curriculum for a subject. Please watch
the tool in action from the PDF/GIF included along with the task.

## Things to Implement:

- Row actions - Indent/ Outdent/ Delete
- Move action - Implement using up/down buttons instead of Drag-Drop as
  shown in the GIF. Bonus points for doing it using Drag-Drop.
- Preserve parent-child relations between nodes while moving, deleting etc.
  Eg. moving an element should also move its children
- The text in each row should be editable like a text box
- Load/ Save - Functionality to generate and download a JSON output and
  to load the JSON to create the structure again
- Use React.js. No need to implement Backend
